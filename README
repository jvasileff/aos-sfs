                                 Anodyneos SFS
================================================================================

Anodyneos SFS generates Java classes from source files that are composed of XML
tags intermixed with Java code.  SFS is used to programatically generate valid
XML documents without the inconvienence of directly using SAX or DOM APIs.

SFS is designed to be extreemly simple and high performance.  Most programming
logic is written in Java and contained within "sfs:logic" tags, although a
limitted number of additional SFS tags exist for convenience, such as "sfs:if",
and "sfs:expr".
